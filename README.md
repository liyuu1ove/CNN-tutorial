Download and setup conda on [conda](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/conda) or [TsinghuaTuna](https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/anaconda/archive/?C=M&O=D)
```shell
$conda
(base)conda create -n pytorch_cpu python=3.9
```
Use [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) python API to build a CNN to recognize MNIST. Pytorch can run on a local machine using CPU, so don't worry about the NVIDIA GPU requirement.

```shell
$conda
(base)conda activate pytorch_cpu
(pytorch_cpu)pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio
```
If you have some trouble in setting up environment, you can use [google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/pytorch/tutorials/blob/gh-pages/_downloads/0e6615c5a7bc71e01ff3c51217ea00da/tensorqs_tutorial.ipynb#scrollTo=Pzb1CuJSbIVT)

Run `test_pytorch` to check if pytorch is available.


## Basic ideas
Lets begin by introducing some basic ideas in CNN and perform them in pytorch.
### Tensor
More on [tensor](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/tensorqs_tutorial.html)

Tensor is the very basic data structure in machine learning. From a developer's prespective, tensor is the nickname of high-dimension array in machine learning. For example, we declare a 2D-array in C:
```C
int arr[m][n];
```
This is a tensor in 2 dimensions.In CNN,it can present a 2D black-white image or a channel of an RGB picture.

Also we can declare a 1D-array aka *vector* in C:
```C
int arr[m];
```

In pytorch,we can declare a tensor using:(*see tensor.py*)
```python
shape = (2,3)
tensor=torch.rand(shape)
``` 
And check its attributes using:
```python
tensor.shape
tensor.dtype
tensor.device
```
And manipulate it using:
```python
tensor.add_(1)
#more linear algebra methods will be introduced in the following section
```
methods with "_" indicate that they store the result in their **original** memory,which is sometimes dangerous.
### Linear Algebra Basics 
#### matrix mutiply
![matmul](asset\Neural_net_layers_as_matrices_and_vectors.png)*from https://khalidsaifullaah.github.io/neural-networks-from-linear-algebraic-perspective*
```python
torch.matmul(tensor_a,tensor_b)
```
#### transpose
```python
tensor_a.T
```

## Neutral Network
### Neuron
![neuron](asset\neuron.jpg)
*from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/neural-networks-a-beginners-guide/*

The basic units that receive inputs, each neuron is governed by a threshold and an **activation function**.
### Activation Function
An ideal activation function is a step function. But it is never used in practice because it is unsmooth and discontinuous. Sigmoid and ReLU(Rectified linear unit) are more common.

![Sigmoid](asset\Activation_logistic.svg.png)
![ReLU](asset\Activation_rectified_linear.svg.png)

*from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activation_function*

The activation function introduce no-linearity to neural network, which really matters. Try to think why. 

Hint! Reflect on matmal.
### Layers in multi-layer feedforward neural network
![multi-layer feedforward neural network](asset\nn-structure.jpg)

*from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/neural-networks-a-beginners-guide/*

#### input layer
This is where the network receives its input data. Each input neuron in the layer corresponds to a feature in the input data.
#### hidden layers
These layers perform most of the computational heavy lifting. A neural network can have one or multiple hidden layers. Each layer consists of units (neurons) that transform the inputs into something that the output layer can use.
#### output layers
The final layer produces the output of the model. The format of these outputs varies depending on the specific task (e.g., classification, regression).

### Forward Propagation
When data is input into the network, it passes through the network in the forward direction, from the input layer through the hidden layers to the output layer. This process is known as forward propagation. Finally a result will be produced at the output layer.

### Loss Function
A loss function is a mathematical function that measures how well a model's predictions match the true outcomes. It provides a quantitative metric for the accuracy of the model's predictions, which can be used to guide the model's training process. The goal of a loss function is to guide optimization algorithms in adjusting model parameters to reduce this loss over time.

Loss functions come in various forms, each suited to different types of problems. In different tasks such as regression,classification or detection.

### Back propagation and Optimizer
![backpropagation](asset\backpropagation.png)
*from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/backpropagation-in-neural-network/*


The most important equation:
$b^{[l]}j\leftarrow b^{[l]}_j-\alpha \frac{\partial L}{\partial b^{[l]}_j}$ $w^{[l]}{jk}\leftarrow w^{[l]}{jk}-\alpha\frac{\partial L}{\partial w^{[l]}{jk}}$

$w$ is the weight 

$a$ is the learning rate

$L$ is the loss function

$\partial$ represents the Optimizer known as Gradient Descent


Backpropagation is also known as "Backward Propagation of Errors" and it is a method used to train neural network . Its goal is to reduce the difference between the model’s predicted output and the actual output by adjusting the weights and biases in the network.

Backpropagation is performed by ``Optimizer`` in PyTorch

## CNN
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is an advanced version of artificial neural networks,primarily designed to extract features from grid-like matrix datasets. This is particularly useful for visual datasets such as images or videos, where data patterns play a crucial role.
### CNN structure

[Yolov8 structure](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/blob/main/ultralytics/cfg/models/v8/yoloe-v8.yaml)

### convolution
![convolution](asset\convolution.gif)
*from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/apply-a-2d-max-pooling-in-pytorch/*

Convolution operations extract localized features (like edges, textures).
Also see `convolution.py` `convolution_maodie.py`
### pooling
![maxpooling](asset\maxpooling.png)
*from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/apply-a-2d-max-pooling-in-pytorch/*

Pooling (downsampling) reduces spatial dimensions to compress features and control overfitting.
Also see `maxpooling.py`

# Build a CNN for MNIST
## Prepare a dataset
Use MNIST dataset.
## Define a CNN
### Activation Function
ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) has become the default choice in many architectures due to its simplicity and efficiency
### Conv layers
Extract features
### Full connection (FC) layers

## Choose a loss func and optimizer
### Categorical Cross-Entropy Loss
Categorical Cross-Entropy Loss is used for multiclass classification problems. It measures the performance of a classification model whose output is a probability distribution over multiple classes.
### SGD optimizer
Gradient descent is an iterative optimization algorithm used to minimize a loss function, which represents how far the model’s predictions are from the actual values. 
In Stochastic Gradient Descent, the gradient is calculated for each training example.

## test
# Learn how to evaluation a model
## attributes
![params and FLOPs](asset\yolov8-comparison-plots.avif)
*from https://docs.ultralytics.com*
### FLOPs/MACs
FLOPs (Floating Point Operations) and MACs (Multiply-Accumulate Operations) are metrics that are commonly used to calculate the computational complexity of deep learning models.Generally,the bigger the number is ,the higher computing ability the model requires.

### params
Parameters in CNNs are primarily the weights and biases learned during training.Generally,the bigger the number is ,the more VRAM the model requires.
## performance metrics
More explanation and real cases in [yolo-performance-metrics](https://docs.ultralytics.com/guides/yolo-performance-metrics/)


### confusion matrix
![confusion matrix](asset\confusion_matrix.png)
The confusion matrix provides a detailed view of the outcomes, showcasing the counts of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives for each class.
### precision/recall
* `Precision` 
quantifies the proportion of true positives among all positive predictions, assessing the model's capability to avoid false positives. 
* `Recall`
calculates the proportion of true positives among all actual positives, measuring the model's ability to detect all instances of a class.
### confidence
The threshold of output a lable.Generally,the higher the confidence,the higher the precision,the lower the recall,verse visa.
### IoU
Intersection over Union is a measure that quantifies the overlap between a predicted bounding box and a ground truth bounding box. It plays a fundamental role in evaluating the accuracy of object localization.
### P_curve
![P_curve](./asset/P_curve.png)
The precision_confidence curve is a graphical representation of precision values at different thresholds.This curve helps in understanding how precision varies as the threshold changes.
### R_curve
![R_curve](./asset/R_curve.png)
Correspondingly, this graph illustrates how the recall values change across different thresholds.
### PR_curve
![PR_curve](./asset/PR_curve.png)
An integral visualization for any classification problem, this curve showcases the trade-offs between precision and recall at varied thresholds. It becomes especially significant when dealing with imbalanced classes.
### F1_curve
![F1_curve](./asset/F1_curve.png)
The F1 Score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced assessment of a model's performance while considering both false positives and false negatives.
## training results
![results](./asset/results.png)
### AP
* `AP`computes the area under the precision-recall curve, providing a single value that encapsulates the model's precision and recall performance.
* `mAP50` Mean average precision 50 calculated at an intersection over union (IoU) threshold of 0.50. It's a measure of the model's accuracy considering only the "easy" detections.
* `mAP50-95`The average of the mean average precision calculated at varying IoU thresholds, ranging from 0.50 to 0.95. It gives a comprehensive view of the model's performance across different levels of detection difficulty.

### box/cls/dfl loss
for more reference [yolo_loss](https://docs.ultralytics.com/reference/utils/loss/)
* `box_loss`Box loss is a criterion class for computing training losses for bounding boxes,composed by IoU Loss and DFL Loss (Distribution Focal Loss)
* `cls_loss`Classification loss measures how well the model classifies or identifies objects correctly. The cls_loss is scaled with pixels and helps determine the accuracy of the model's object classification capabilities.
* `dfl_loss`Distribution Focal Loss is a criterion class for computing distribution focal loss,helping improve the model's ability to precisely locate objects in images by predicting probability distributions rather than direct coordinates.

During the train process, you are expected to see the loss dropping in a fluctuating manner.It is common.
